# Ec2Rdp
Ec2Rdp is a console app for Windows that gets the IP address of your instance, updates your local RDP file, and then runs it through Remote Desktop. It also starts the instance if its not already running.

## Platform
Here's my setup; but you can probably adapt this to other versions.
.NET Framework 4.7.2
Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition

## Getting Started - EC2 Beginners
If you don't know how to program EC2 with the .NET Framework SDK, I'll point you to a tutorial; but you probably already have an EC2 account, so you don't need to create a new account, as the tutorial instructs; you just need to go into your console and setup an access key. You can probably figure out how to do that by reading the tutorial and poking around the console.
